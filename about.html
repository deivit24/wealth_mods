          <p>Where to begin…</p>
          <p>
            When I was a freshman in college, I read “The Little Book That Beats the Market” by Joel Greenblatt. I was
            inspired so much that I somehow convinced my parents to lend me $1,000 so I could invest in the stock
            market. I also promised them that I would quadruple their money.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t know whether I was naïve or just plain gullible, but that was my first experience investing in the
            stock market or investing in general. It left a bad taste in my mouth and was wary of the stock market for
            the next couple of years. However, it was a humbling experience as well and learned from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to the present, and I now have a B.A. in Accounting, Master’s degree in Finance Management, the
            Principal Owner of a
            <a href="https://armisfinancial.com" target="a_blank" class="link">Wealth Management Firm</a>
            and currently pursuing my CFP designation. Sounds legit right?
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most important reason why I started my own business and now starting this blog is due to my past
            experiences working in a big firm financial service industry. If you continue reading, I am going to share
            with you the truth about working for a big financial service firm from both the client and advisor
            perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will show you what I learned, what I hated, what I loved, and what can be improved. But more Importantly,
            my mission is to start adding Wealth MODs in your life to take control or improve on your current financial
            situation. You will not only have financial independence but financial clarity as well!

        It was tough to put into words to describe the reasons why I disliked working for a large financial service
        firm. So instead I am going to share real stories that happened and experiences that led me to the decision I
        had to make: either quit my dream job and start a different profession or start my own Independent firm and make
        a difference. I chose the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made four simple cards that share my true stories and experiences.

                As part of our rigorous training to be a Stock Broker/Financial Advisor, we were taught how to call
                clients and aggressively sell them investment products or convince them to make a transaction
                (buy/sell).
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon graduating from training, I was now out in the field as a full-fledged financial advisor. I also
                thought that I would never be put in a position in which I had to aggressively sell anything to clients.
                I was naïve. We were obligated to attend “call sessions” twice a month. This is where all of the new
                advisors from the region will sit down around a huge table and start calling their clients and start
                trying to set appointments and sell.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sessions will typically last an hour. Afterward, we would sit and listen to “inspirational” stories
                from the leaders of our region on how much money they made in one phone call. I can vividly remember a
                leader from my region printing out a list of my oldest clients and handing them over to me. The leader
                said, “call them, you can sell them anything, and they will say yes.”
              </p>
              <p>
                This left an awful taste in my mouth because there wasn’t a mention of how and what I can do to help.
                Just call the clients and make a transaction. I did some research to see how other firms operated, and
                they were all similar.

                I remember one of my very first appointments being with a young family. Both parents were in their early
                30’s and their son that was 14 months old. I believe that I gave them the best possible advice
                considering their financial situation. Both were going to start contributing more to their IRAs and
                opened a 529 College Fund account for their son.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our bi-weekly meeting with our mentors and leaders, I mentioned the family and the advice that I
                provided. They were upset that I was wasting my time with “small fish.” They kept on insisting that they
                were going to put an anchor in my business. Unfortunately, they were right.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are working for a large financial service firm, they are going to look out for the best
                interest of the firm. It makes sense. Regrettably, that means you have to cater your business to a
                smaller group of individuals and to leave groups that need help the most behind.

                In the latter part of my employment with this firm, I experience something that was very uncomfortable.
                Our region was not at the top for selling life insurance and annuities. We had to go through more
                extensive training on how to sell more life insurance and annuities.
              </p>
              <p>
                It started to feel like I was more of a salesman than a financial advisor. I was taught what to say to
                combat any situation they might have in order to sell an annuity. It wasn’t what was best for the
                client; it was what was best for corporate pockets.

                Almost every new advisor working at a large firm has experience advising a client to invest in something
                you didn’t honestly believe in or understand because it might help you meet your sales goal. It is valid
                for nearly every advisor that has worked for a large firm.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was once put in a position in which I had to choose between selling an investment product that didn’t
                benefit the client or telling them the truth. I chose the latter and was scrutinized by “leaders” in my
                field. It was the final straw the broke the camel’s back, to say the least. That is why I decided it was
                time to make a change.

        I’m pleased that I went through all my experiences because If it weren’t for them, I wouldn’t have started my
        business. One of the main reasons why I wanted to continue working as a Financial Advisor was because I enjoyed
        building financial plans that benefited them not the firm and because I loved the value I was providing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt the only way I could do that is by going on my own and here is why:

                The best feeling I had when I started working for myself as an Independent advisor was that I was
                finally honest with myself. I didn’t have to convince myself that what I was doing was in the best
                interest of the client. I knew that it was.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wasn’t obligated to attend monthly call sessions or sit-downs with leaders in the region to discuss
                how to sell more investment products. No more “Inspirational Stories” on how veteran financial advisors
                can sell anything to anyone. More importantly, I didn’t feel like I was tricking anyone to making a
                transaction. There a new vibe to it all because I can start focusing on what really mattered, my
                clients.

                I had no one tell me who I can and can’t help. I always envisioned myself as an advisor that was able to
                meet the needs of any client regardless of economic or social status. I was able to give compressional
                financial planning advice without the huge price tag involved. As a millennial, my goals are not only to
                cater to folks that are about to retire but to individuals that that are about to start their investing
                journey as well.

                If there is one situation that I hated being the most in is explaining how a particular investment
                product pays me differently than another or explaining that I get paid every time I place a trade. I
                wanted to eliminate as many conflicts of interests as possible. Hence by being a fee-only advisor, I
                don’t get paid by how much or what sell but by the advice I provide.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the financial well-being of the client and not a
                corporate firm.

                I am now able to provide value and investment advice that doesn’t compromise my moral compass. No more
                lectures from product partners on why one investment is better (pays more) than the other. I am able to
                pick and choose investments from that are best suited for my clients.

                I am also able to partner with various independent research analysis firms, custodians, and financial
