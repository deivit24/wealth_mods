          <h2>General Product/Performance Disclaimers</h2>
          <p>Nothing else contained on this site should be used or construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an
            offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security. Nor is it intended as investment, tax, financial or
            legal advice. Investors should seek such professional advice for their particular situation. </p>
          <p>This site is published in the United States for residents of the United States. Investors outside of the
            United States are subject to securities and tax regulations within their applicable jurisdictions that are
            not addressed on this site. Nothing on this site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to
            sell shares of any investment in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under
            the securities laws of such jurisdiction. U.S. investors are advised that not all investments described on
            this site are available for sale in all states. </p>
          <p>The performance information presented on this web site is historical and is not indicative of future
            results. Investment returns and the principal may vary, and at the time of sale, your investment may be
            worth more or less than its original cost. It is possible to lose money by investing in these funds. These
            investments are not deposits or obligations of or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not federally
            insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or any other agency.
            Exchange-Traded funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value. </p>
          <p>Municipal investments offer income free from federal income tax. Distributions may be subject to state and
            local taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains will be subject to capital gains taxes. </p>
          <p>Some featured products invest in international securities, which can involve different risks than U.S.
            investments. These risks include political or economic instability, difficulty in predicting global trade
            patterns, lack of publicly available information about foreign companies, changes in foreign currency
            exchange rates and the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations. </p>
          <p>Some of the investments and services on this site may not be available in or appropriate for a retirement
            savings plan. Please contact your financial advisor about any investment restrictions associated with your
            particular plan. </p>
