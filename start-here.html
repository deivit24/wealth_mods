      <p>What do I mean by that? I mean you can’t be successful in this day and age using the same principles that the
        Silent Generation (1925 – 1945) and Baby boomers (1946 – 1964) taught you. </p>

      <p>Let me guess. They said go to school, get good grades, work hard and you will find success. Does this sound
        familiar? Of course it does. It has been repeated over and over again to the Millennial Generation (1977 –
        1995) and Generation Z (1996 – 2015).</p>
      <p>So, what did these past generations have in the “Good Old Days” that we the Millennials and the Gen Z don’t
        have? I will sum it up in these three cards below.</p>

              <p>Rising tuition for both private and public colleges has been no secrete over the past couple of years.
                According to GoBankingRates, the average annual tuition of the oldest Boomer’s (1964) entering a
                four-year public college was $243 and $1,088 for private school. Just to put things in perspective,
                given inflation according to the Consumer Price Index, $243 would cost $1,990.27 in 2018 and $1,088
                would be $8,911.18.</p>
              <p>The youngest Boomer would have been entering college in 1982. The average tuition for a four-year
                college in 1982 was $1,031 and $4,639 for a private school. That would be $2,707.29 and $12,181.47,
                respectively in 2018.</p>
              <p>Flash forward to the 2018-2019 school year. The average tuition of a four-year public (In-State)
                school is $9,716. That is an average academic inflation of %7.07 a year from 1964 to 2018 for a
                four-year public school. The average tuition for a private four-year school $35,676 That is an average
                academic inflation rate of %6.67 a year.</p>

              <p>According to the Urban Institute, in 1989, when boomers where in their 20’s and 30’s, the average
                student loan borrower owed less than $2,000. Flash forward to the 2018-2019 school year, the average
                graduate has a student loan debt of $29,800 in both federal and private debt. The average monthly
                student loan payment, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, is $393. </p>
              <p>What implications does this have? Tons! For starters, they have less money to save for their financial
                goals (Retirement, Travel, etc.). They also are more hesitant to buy a home and start building equity
                in it. </p>

              <p>What is this “College Degree Arms Race”? In order to understand this term, we first must understand
                the statistics. A 2017 report by advocacy group Young Invincibles found that a baby boomer with no
                college degree and no debt in 1989 was making the same amount of money as a millennial with debt and a
                college degree. Let that sink in.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the report also found that boomers were earning $10,000 more than millennials when they
                were young adults. Boomers were making $50,910 at ages 25 to 34 in 1989, adjusted to 2013 dollars.
                Millennials, on the other hand, were earning just $40,581 according to the same report.</p>
              <p>That being said, millennials started furthering their education past a bachelor’s degree no only in
                order to compete with the current job market competition but to make the same amount as a boomer would
                have made with a bachelor’s degree. Hence the term “College Degree Arms Race”. </p>
