      <p>Let me guess. They said to go to school, get good grades, work hard and you will find success. Does this sound
        familiar? Of course, it does. It has been repeated over and over again to the Millennial Generation (1977 –
        1995) and Generation Z (1996 – 2015).</p>
      <p>So, what did these past generations have in the “Good Old Days” that we the Millennials and the Gen Z don’t
        have? I will sum it up in these three cards below.</p>

              <p>Rising tuition for both private and public colleges has been no secret over the past couple of years.
                According to GoBankingRates, the average annual tuition of the oldest Boomer’s (1964) entering a
                four-year public college was $243 and $1,088 for private school. Just to put things in perspective,
                given inflation according to the Consumer Price Index, $243 would cost $1,990.27 in 2018, and $1,088
                would be $8,911.18.</p>
              <p>The youngest Boomer would have been entering college in 1982. The average tuition for a four-year
                college in 1982 was $1,031 and $4,639 for a private school. That would be $2,707.29 and $12,181.47,
                respectively in 2018.</p>
              <p>Flash forward to the 2018-2019 school year. The average tuition of a four-year public (In-State) school
                is $9,716. That is an average academic inflation of %7.07 a year from 1964 to 2018 for a four-year
                public school. The average tuition for a private four-year school is $35,676. That is an average

              <p>According to the Urban Institute, in 1989, when boomers where in their 20’s and 30’s, the average
                student loan borrower owed less than $2,000. Flash forward to the 2018-2019 school year, the average
                graduate has a student loan debt of $29,800 in both federal and private debt. The average monthly
                student loan payment, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, is $393. </p>
              <p>What implications does this have? Tons! For starters, they have less money to save for their financial
                goals (Retirement, Travel, etc.). They also are more hesitant to buy a home and start building equity
                in it. </p>

              <p>What is this “College Degree Arms Race”? To understand this term, we first must understand the
                statistics. A 2017 report by the advocacy group Young Invincibles found that a baby boomer with no
                college degree and no debt in 1989 was making the same amount of money as a millennial with student debt
                and a college degree. Let that sink in.
              </p>
              <p>Furthermore, the report also found that boomers were earning $10,000 more than millennials when they
                were young adults. Boomers were making $50,910 at ages 25 to 34 in 1989, adjusted to 2013 dollars.
                Millennials, on the other hand, were earning just $40,581 according to the same report.</p>
              <p>That being said, millennials started furthering their education past a bachelor’s degree not only to
                compete with the current job market competition but to make the same amount as a boomer would have made
                with a bachelor’s degree. Hence the term “College Degree Arms Race.”</p>

      <h1>Due Diligence is key </h1>
      <p>Whether it’s family, friend, or colleague, always do your due diligence before placing all your bets into
        something they suggest. They may be genuinely looking out for your best interest but remember, what can be
        useful for them, may be detrimental to you. There is no “One Size Fits All” type of investment.</p>
      <p>Before you hire a financial advisor, do a full background check before hiring one. This is a <a
          href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="a_blank">free tool</a> to research the background and experience
        of financial brokers, advisors, and firms.</p>

      <p>It's a journey, enjoy the detours

        detours along the way.</p>
      <h3>You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest because that's where you'll find the things more important
        than what you want. - Yoshihiro Togashi</h3>
