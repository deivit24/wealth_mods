          <h2>What is a 401(k)?</h2>
          <p class="body"> <br>
            A 401(k) is a retirement plan that is provided to you by your employer. It allows employees to save a piece of their paycheck and invest it before taxes are taken out. You are hence decreasing your taxable income, similar to a <a href="Traditional-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Traditional IRA</a>.
          </p>

          
          <p class="body">
            There are some individuals that I have met that have no idea if their employer offers a 401(k)-retirement plan or if they are even participating in it. I know how it feels when you get hired for a job, and you start filling out the paperwork. In most instances, you just want to sign the dotted line and get it over with. However, you can be missing out on important information.
          </p>

          <p class="body">
            Let's start with how to oversee and access your 401(k) account. Your employer generally hires a 401(k) administrator (TIAA, Transamerica, Fidelity, etc.) They'll usually mail or email you updates on the performance of the plan. If you have not received any of that, you should visit your administrator's website and access your account. You can then change the settings for notifications. If you don't know if you have an account, call you the administrator's customer service, they should be able to help.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Key Details</h2>
          <p class="body"> <br>
            With that settled, let's start with the essential details that pertain to everyone that chooses to participate in a 401(k):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With that settled, let's start with the essential details that pertain to everyone that chooses to participate in a 401(k):
            </li>

            <li>
              The total contribution limit for 2019 is $19,000 if you are under the age of 50; $25,000 for those 50 and older.
            </li>

            <li>
              You can only choose between a pre-selected short list of investments that are offered by the plan administrator.
            </li>

            <li>
              Investments grow tax-deferred. Investments grow tax-free if it's a Roth 401(k).
            </li>

            <li>
              Withdrawals over the age of 59 ½ are taxed as ordinary income. Tax-free if it's a Roth 401(k).
            </li>

            <li>
              If you withdraw before the age of 59 ½, gains and contributions are taxed as ordinary income and are subject to a 10% penalty unless you one of the qualifying exemptions:
              <ul>
                <li>You are disabled</li>
                <li>Certain medical expenses</li>
                <li>You are 55 or older and are either retired or left the employer associated with the 401(k) </li>
                <li>You must give part of your 401(k) due to a court order (separation agreement or divorce decree)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        
          </ul>

          <p class="body">
            Now let's dive into two critical caveats that make investing into your employer's 401(k) worthwhile. Some employers offer it some don't: Matching and Vesting Restrictions.
          </p>


          <h2>Does your employer offer a match?</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>One of the most significant benefits of contributing to a 401(k) is a matching program.  This is when your employer matches a portion of the money you contribute to the plan. Every employer is different, but the most common arrangement is a 6% match. This means that your employer will match up to 6% of your annual income only if you do. For instance, if your salary is $60,000 a year, your employer will contribute up to $3,600 ($60,000 X 6%) if you do. If you contribute more, your employer will only match $3,600 for that given year. If you contribute less, they will match what you contribute. This is what advisors call "free money," so don't bypass on the opportunity if you have it.</p>
          
          
          <h2>What are the Vesting Restrictions? </h2>
          
          <p class="body"><br>
            Vesting can be a confusing word that is mostly seen in your benefits section of the employer handbook. All your contributions from your paycheck are 100% vested, meaning they are 100% yours when your part ways from your employer. However, the matching contributions made by your employer differ.  Every employer has different restrictions. Generally speaking, contributions from the employer's vest over time - usually anywhere from 25% to 33% a year. If you happen to leave your employer after the first year, you can 100% of the contributions you made and only 25% or 33% of contributions made from your employer. Once you meet their time restrictions, you are 100% vested.
          </p>
          <p class="body">As stated, every employer had different matching policies and vesting restrictions. I have me individuals that work at places that have a very generous matching and vesting policies - like automatically matching 6% of your income if you can contribute at least 1% and matching contributions are 100% vested immediately. If you don't know what your employers matching policies and vesting restrictions are, you should revisit your employer handbook and paperwork to find out. </p>
          <h2>What are the Investment Options?</h2>
          <p class="body">
          <br>
          
If there were any cons to participating in in a 401(k) with a matching program, it would be their limited selection of investment options. Most providers offer a narrow array of mutual funds, composed of money market, bonds and stocks. Most providers are transitioning to target-date funds. These are funds that gradually get more conservative as you reach closer to your retirement age. You only have control of which model portfolio or investments to choose from the list. So, there might be investments that you don't like or find them to be expensive.

          </p>
          <h2>What are the costs</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <br />The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a not-for-profit organization that is authorized by Congress to protect American Investors by making sure that brokers are operating fairly and honestly. There a cool online-tool called the FINRA Fund Analyzer that that allows you to compare fees and expenses among funds -- including different classes of the same fund. They use a data feed that takes expense data for thousands of funds; the analyzer can help you comprehend the impact fees have on your investment throughout your employment. You can select up to three funds, type in the current amount or the amount you plan to invest, and for how long you plan to keep the fund, the analyzer does the rest. It's always a good idea to be aware of the fees that you are paying not only to the plan administrator but to the actual funds as well.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>It's evident that contributing to a 401(k), especially if they offer to match, has more upsides than downsides. Nevertheless, as stated in MOD 9, you must always do your due diligence when trying to decide which investments to choose. That being said, we have compiled the pros and cons of having a 401(k) account to summarize:</p>

                <li>
                  Higher annual contribution limits ($19,000 if you are under the age of 50 and $25,000 for those 50 and older in 2019).

            Most employers allow you to enroll in a 401(k)-retirement plan right away; nevertheless, there are smaller companies that might make you wait a specified period. You have control of decreasing and increasing (given you don't reach the limit) the contributions any time. Your spouse will automatically inherit your 401(k) if you were to pass away. If you are not married, it would be a great idea to elect a beneficiary. If for some reason the company you are working for go bankrupt, don't panic, your 401(k) won't go with them. The plan will be terminated, and they will send you either a check or a deposit of what is left in your plan. You will then have a 60-day rollover period to roll it over to an IRA if you don't want a tax penalty.
