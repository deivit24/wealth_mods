            Let's face it, over the last couple of decades, the definition of "career" has changed. It's rare to find people that have been working for the same employer from the start of their career. You might hear stories from baby-boomers about their loyalty to their employers that provided them with lifetime benefits and pensions.
          </p>
                
          <p class="body">
            Those days are almost gone.
          </p>          
          <p class="body">
            In today's world, the modern "gig" economy (contract work, part-time jobs, or side hustles) has allowed people to generate income in creative ways. Some people have more than one part-time job to blend the income together, or they have a part-time job on top of a full-time.
          </p>

          <p class="body">
            In fact, a study by Intuit (the QuickBooks and TurboTax people) predicted that by the year 2020, 40% of American workers will be participating in the gig economy.
          </p>
         
          <p class="body">The main culprit to why American's (millennials for the most part), are rapidly transitioning towards the gig economy is to design a better work-life balance.</p>
          
          
          <p class="body">What is the tradeoff to the better work-life balance? You guessed it! You make less money. By making less money, it might affect your financial future. How? (Besides the obvious point that you won't be making as much money as you would in a full-time job.) Read on to find out.</p>

          <h2>Living for now but planning for later</h2>
          
          <p class="body"><br>
            You've probably been forced into a tight budget due to the fewer hours of work. Unless you have found a way to reduce your expenses significantly, always worked part-time, or have significant savings. Many people who have chosen to work part-time would agree that having more free time is worth the frugal lifestyle. However, that line of thinking is short-term.
          </p>
          
          <p class="body">
            Reducing your spending when you earn less money may help to pay your bills. But will it allow you to set money aside and invest for your retirement years?
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            If you are just part-time because you are waiting for an inheritance, then this is not for you.
          </p>
         
          <p class="body">However, if you really enjoy working part-time and its part of your long-term plan, then it's essential to be looking into the future. The preservation phase of life. Otherwise, the lifestyle you are looking for or currently living in will vanish if you don't save enough money to fund your retirement.</p>
          <p class="body">
            Many people have felt the stress of a full-time job and don't miss it at all. They love the schedule they have because they get to pursue more wellness and creative activities. But can the decreased stress now increase later in life? Of course.
          </p>
         
          <h2>How to prepare for the future as a part-time worker</h2>
         <p class="body"><br>
          If you plan on working part-time, use the extra time you have to plan for retirement proactively. Here are the 4 steps you can take to start planning for the future:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Cautiously keep track of your expenses and use a <a href="50-30-20-Budget-Method.html" class="link" target="a_blank">budget</a>. There are many financial programs out there that allow you to set a budget and monitor it monthly while keeping track of your net worth. However, beware of free ones. They tend to sell your information out. If you have a smaller income, you have to keep track of what you spend. That way, you can see how much you can set aside for emergencies or invest periodically for retirement. For those that want to try the financial planning program that I use for my firm for free (I pay for it), I will give you a 6-month free trial! <a href="https://www.rightcapital.com/sign-up?referral=Kv1ZesPE-mI27DuLGHsxCw&type=client" target="a_blank" class="link"> click here</a> if you are interested.
          </li>
          <li>If you work a W-2 part-time job, it doesn't hurt to check if your employer offers any benefits you can capitalize on. Not all employers offer benefits to part-timers, but some do offer limited benefits because it helps retain great employees. Take advantage of any benefits that an employer provides because that can be extra cash that can be set aside for your budget! Here is a list of the  top ten employers that offer <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5752-part-time-jobs-with-benefits.html" target="a_blank" class="link"> part-time jobs with benefits</a>.</li>
          <li>Keep in mind that Social Security exists! Some people don't include it because they believe it will not be around in the future. According to the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html" target="a_blank" class="link">Social Security Administration</a>, scheduled benefits will continue on a timely basis for many years to come. However, it's a smart decision to delay S.S. benefits until you reach full retirement age to receive maximized payments.</li>
          <li>As mentioned in <a href="../start-here.html" class="link">Wealth MOD 8</a>, invest in your personal development. One of the most significant returns on investment you can have is by investing in yourself. Before you can give to others, you must give to yourself. Whether it's learning a new skill, reading, developing yourself professionally or personally, hiring a coach, or listening to a podcast, you need to grow or challenge yourself to succeed continually.</li>
        </ol>
         
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="body"><br>
          If you chose to work part-time to decrease your stress, remember that reduces your income as well. It is essential to realize that you must take care of your future self as well. There are expenses later in life that increases as you age. Such as increase chances of illness and injuries. Without the benefits of a full-time job to help you take care of those expenses, you must be diligent in saving.
        </p>
         

          <p class="body">
            It's almost effortless to brush off retirement and say, "I will think about it later." It starts by sitting down and creating a plan and monitoring its progress.
          </p>
        <p class="body">
          If you start planning for retirement early, even part-timers can enjoy a pleasant retirement.
        </p>
        
<p class="body">What is important is that you realized that you need to have a budget, now you just need to take the first step, whether it's today or tomorrow.</p>

<p class="body">Financial planning takes time, and many variables come into play. It's not all about cutting expenses and living miserably. With the right plan, anybody can start saving while still having an enjoyable life.</p>
        
          <p class="body">
            Rightfully choosing the right investments takes a substantial amount of planning.
