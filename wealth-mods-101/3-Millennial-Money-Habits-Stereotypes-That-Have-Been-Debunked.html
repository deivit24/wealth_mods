          <p class="body">“Foolish when it comes to money,” “They don’t plan for the long-term,” “They are
            self-centered,”
            “They still depend on their parents.” Those are the typical stereotypes that one might hear about a
            Millennial.
            As a Millennial myself, it always stung a little bit every time I heard one of those statements. Maybe it
            was
            because deep down inside, I felt like it was the truth. In spite of those negative stereotypes, I found that
            they don’t hold up to the facts.</p>
          <p class="body">
            The age of Millennials as of today range from 38 to 23. It’s hard to deny the fact that this generation will
            have a hard time retiring due to these factors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Record-Breaking Student Debt that inhibits millennials from saving and investing.
            </li>
            <li>The uncertain future of Social Security which is a safety net and a pillar to our retirement system.
            </li>
            <li>Lower wages compared to Baby Boomers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">Despite being dealt a bad hand, the future is not that bleak. According to recent research on
            Millennials, most of them are financially stable – if not more than in past generations. Here are three
            Millennial money habit stereotypes that have been debunked:</p>
          <h2>Myth 1: Millennials Are Not Saving Money</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>There is a broad believed notion that Millennials are poor at managing money – they saving
            and
            they overspend on unnecessary good and services. But here are the facts:</p>

          <p class="body">According to a recent report in 2018, 63% of Millennials are saving money, and 54% of them
            have a
            budget. They are on par when compared to Generation-X and Baby-Boomers. </p>

          <p class="body">When it comes to having a savings and feeling financially secure, they are not only at par
            with
            past generations – they surpass them. 57% of Millennials have a real savings goal while only 42% of both
            Generation-X and Baby-Boomers have a savings goal. 59% of Millennials feel financially secure while only 54%
            of
            Generation-X feels financially secure. </p>

          <p class="body">In regards to how much Millennials are saving:</p>

          <p class="body"> The percentage of Millennials that have $15,000 or more in their savings is around 47% in
            2018.
            In 2015, the percentage was 33%. In 2015, only 8% of Millennials had at least $100k in savings. In 2018, 16%
            of
            Millennials had saved up to $100k in savings. It is safe to say that we are improving year by year.</p>

          <p class="body">According to the 2018 report, 67% of Millennials stick to their savings goal month after month
            while 73% of Millennials that have a budget, actually stick to it month after month.</p>

          <h3 class="debunked">Myth Debunked</h3>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Myth 2: When the Job is hard, Millennials quit</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>The gig economy has been around for a while and spread like wilder fire after the
            2008-2009
            financial melt-down. It’s a type of labor that refers to a temporary work or a side-gig, hence the term “gig
            economy.” Airbnb, Lyft, Favor, and freelancers are all examples that align with gig economy term, and
            according
            to the 2018 report, 25% say that they actives participants in the gig economy. Not only that, but they also
            state they will have around eight jobs or more during their lifetime.</p>


          <p class="body">However, while some Millennials are known to be for job-hopping, it’s not primarily their
            fault.
            Around a quarter of Millennials have been laid off. Due to having higher student loan debts and lower wages
            when
            compared to past generations, 47% of Millennials need another source of income or side gig at some point. If
            there is an opportunity to earn a higher salary or have two or more side gigs to pay off debt or save more,
            would you “hop” around?</p>


          <p class="body">There is an independent study, where a diverse sample of over 100,000 employees were surveyed
            in
            regards to job satisfaction, in which they had exciting findings. Millennials have not only reported higher
            levels of job satisfaction when compared to Gen Xers and Boomers, but they reported similar levels of
            fulfillment in pay, work benefits, and turnover intentions according to an independent study by the Journal
            of
            Business and Psychology. </p>

          <h3 class="debunked">Myth Debunked</h3>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Myth 3: Millennials don’t plan for the Future</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>Talking about finances is one of the top sources of tension not only in Millennial
            households
            but for any household. In fact, according to marriage.com, finances are the number 2 reason for divorces in
            the
            United States. Whether it’s due to different financial goals, spending habits, or one spouse making more
            than
            the other, money impacts the lives of anything it touches.</p>

          <p class="body">However, when it comes to planning for the future, Millennials put in more consideration to
            finances when planning for the future. For instance, when it comes to marriage, Millennials are waiting
            longer
            to get married because they are planning more strategically about their life in regards to their career and
            financial future. According to the Pew Research Center, 29% of Millennials are not financially ready to get
            married.</p>

          <p class="body">Keeping Finances separated:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>28% of Millennial couples keep their finances separate</li>
            <li>11% for Generation-X</li>
            <li>13% for Baby-Boomers</li>
          </ul>


          <p class="body">Cost of raising kids as a significant consideration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>30% of Millennials say that the cost of raising kids plays a vital role when deciding to start a family
            </li>
            <li>22% for Generation-X</li>
            <li>Only 9% for Baby Boomers </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">YIt’s safe to say that Millennials do plan for the long-term when it comes to their finances.
            They
            get married and have kids later in life as opposed to their generational counterparts. </p>
          <h3 class="debunked">Myth Debunked</h3>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>Although the stereotypical myths about Millennials have been debunked, that doesn’t mean
            we
            should be complacent. We can do better. In the face of having moderately healthy money habits, 25% of
            Millennials still often worry about their finances. According to a Financial Survey, in collaboration with
            Bank
            of America and USA Today, these are the top five financial worries for Millennials:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><span>35% of Millennials say that not saving enough is their number one financial stressor</span> </li>
            <li><span>24% of Millennials say that their career path is their top stressor </span></li>
            <li><span>21% state it’s not planning and saving for retirement </span></li>
            <li><span>20% state it's not able to afford a home</span></li>
            <li><span>19% say its Health Costs</span></li>
          </ol>

          <p class="body">Regardless of the financial stress, one this is certain, sitting down and having a written
            plan is
