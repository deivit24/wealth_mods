            There are many investment and savings vehicles out there that are designed to help you prepare for one of
            the most challenging financial goals you can have - retirement. You can save all your money into a checking
            account, savings account, a Certificate Deposits (CDs) or even putting all your hard earned cash under a
            mattress but that is not recommended. However, there is an investment vehicle that has extraordinary tax
            benefits:
          </p>

          <h2>Roth IRA</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <br />The Individual Retirement Account or IRA is like a cousin to the 401(k). It's a portable retirement
            account that is not associated with an individual's employer. However, unlike a 401(k) and a <a
              href="Traditional-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Traditional
              IRA</a>, the contributions to a Roth IRA are not taxed deductible. Then what is so good about them?
          </p>

          <p class="body">
            Here are the essential features of a Roth IRA:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The only person that can contribute and own an IRA is yourself. Both you and your spouse may each have one
              but not share it.
            </li>

            <li>
              Anyone with Earned Income is eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA depending on how much you make.
            </li>

            <li>
              For 2019, you can contribute a max of $6,000. If you are older than 50, you can contribute up to $7,000.
            </li>

            <li>
              Contributions are <strong>not</strong> tax-deductible; in laymen terms, you <strong>can't</strong>
              "write-off" these contributions as expenses.
            </li>

            <li>
              Gains grow tax-free.
            </li>

            <li>
              You can withdraw your contributions at any time.
            </li>

            <li>
              Early Withdrawals on gains are subject to a tax penalty unless you meet certain conditions.
            </li>

            <li>
              There are no Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="body">
            Roth IRAs are a great investment vehicle when it comes to saving for retirement, especially if you believe
            you will be at a higher tax bracket in the future. One of the reasons many individuals don't want to start
            contributing to a retirement account is because they believe that once they contribute, they aren't allowed
            to touch it until they are "old." It's not true. Now you may get taxed if you don't meet certain conditions,
            but when it comes to a Roth IRA, you can take out your contributions whenever you want, and there is no age
            limit on when you are not allowed to contribute, unlike the <a href="Traditional-IRA-MOD-2019.html"
              class="link">Traditional IRA</a>. However, certain conditions
            must be met in order to be able to withdraw your earnings tax-free, and there are Contribution Limitations
            based on your income.
          </p>

            <br />

            <li>
              <strong>Withdrawal Penalties on Gains </strong> – You can withdraw the gains from your account, without
              incurring a tax penalty if you opened the account, made your first contribution at least five years ago,
              and meet at least one of the following conditions:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Your age is at least 59 ½.</li>
              <li>You are disabled</li>
              <li>First home purchase (up to $10,000 max)</li>

            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <br />Clearly, the Roth IRA account has far more upsides than downsides. Nevertheless, as stated in MOD 9,
            you must always do your due diligence when anyone recommends a particular investment vehicle or product over
            another. That being said, we have compiled the pros and cons of having a Roth IRA account to summarize:

            Now to address the elephant in the room, in case you haven't noticed it. You have to select the investments
            that go into the account. People always tend to forget or don't realize that IRAs are just buckets that hold
            investments (Stocks, Bonds, ETFs, Mutual Funds, CDs, etc.), not an investment itself. I have met people that
            thought if they open up an IRA and start contributing, you will start seeing a 6% - 8% annual return. I
            don't blame them because most of what they read or see, don't explain how they obtain that annual return.
            So, they believe IRAs are investments within itself.
          </p>
          <p class="body">There is a multitude of factors that go into the decision-making process of choosing the right
            investment that is good for you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Obtaining and understanding your capacity to take risk and your
              emotional tolerance to risk. Also known as your risk profile.
            </li>

            <li>
              Diversifying between the right mix of investments (Stocks, Bonds,
              ETFs, Mutual Funds, CDs, etc.). Also known as asset allocation.
            </li>

            <li>
