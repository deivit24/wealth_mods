            There will come a time where you have to part ways with your employer – whether you quit your job to find a better one or you simply get fired. Regardless of how it happens, it happens, especially this day and age with the gig economy. But now you have your employer-sponsored retirement plan (401k) in limbo. Here are the options that are available to you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Take It</strong> – Cash out; however, it may be subject to tax penalties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Leave It</strong> – You can leave the money in your past employer's plan if they allow it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Move It</strong> – You can move the funds to your new employer's plan, depending on terms of the new policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll It</strong> – You can roll over (move it) to an IRA to preserve the tax benefits.</li>
          </ul>

          
          <p class="body">
            These options come with certain caveats that will be explained. My goal by the time you are done reading this is that you have a clear understanding of your options, and you can decide on what to do. Let's start with the most accessible and most reactionary:
          </p>

          <h2>Option 1: Take it </h2>

          <p class="body"><br/> 
            Taking it may seem fair. It's like "Hey, I have been working and contributing to my <a class="link" href="401k-MOD-2019.html"> 401(k)</a> for years. Why can't I have it back?" Good question but the reality is that employer-sponsored plans were created so employees can save a piece of their paycheck and invest it before taxes are taken out. This would reduce your taxable income. It's quite a tax-benefit, so the government will not just let you take out your <a class="link" href="401k-MOD-2019.html"> 401(k)</a> without being taxed as ordinary income and a suffering a 10% tax-penalty it if you haven't met your time requirements or meet one of the qualifying exemptions. 
          </p>
          

          <p class="body">
            So keep in mind, taking your money is an option, but in most circumstances, I would say don't. Not only because of tax ramifications but because when someone takes it out, that usually stops their momentum of saving for retirement. There is a card labeled "True Story" that expands at the bottom of this paragraph if you click on it. It's a short real-life example of someone that "accidentally" cashed out of their 401(k) account. Or skip it so we can go on to the next option.
          </p>

                  <p>
                    I received a call from a friend of mine that is a nurse in Wisconsin around the beginning of May. She wanted to share what happened to her this past tax season. It was a nightmare. She was working as a nurse for the past three years. She didn't know that she was participating in her 401(K) for the past three years! She was contributing 5% of her paycheck and receiving a 5% match. So for simple math, let's say her salary was $60,000. That means her contribution was $3,000 ($60,000 X 5%) plus the $3,000 match. That is $6,000 a year for three years plus the earnings of her investments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Depending on your employer, you automatically enroll in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. Depending on the policy, they sometimes won't let you keep your 401(k) so what they do is they cash it out and send you a check. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So imagine you quit your job, didn't know you had a retirement plan that you were participating in, and you receive $20k+ check in the mail. If you do not know the implications of what to do or don't read the fine print, you would think this check was a "severance package." And that is what my friend thought. So what would most millennials do? Spend it. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She spent the money and come tax season, anything that has a number on it, there is tax form for it that you will most likely receive in the mail. If you are one of those people that hates taxes and worries about it at the last minute, there can be implications that could have been avoided if you prepare for it. For instance, the tax form, that you give to your HR Block Tax Advisor or if you are a DIY and use TurboTax, states you made an extra $20k+ in 2018, and it bumped up to a higher tax bracket. That is what happened to my friend. She claimed she didn't know, which was the truth, but it did not matter. She had 60 days to roll it over to an IRA to avoid the tax ramifications. 
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not saying you have to roll it over but be aware of the consequences if you don't. It is better to know what is coming than being blindsided and receiving a smaller refund than you were supposed to or owing more in taxes. Thanks for expanding this card and taking the time to read. Here is what would happen if you didn't know:</p>
                  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYNB04rBb51QNtC/giphy.gif" alt="">
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            
            
          </div>

          <p class="body">
            The next three options will allow you to keep the tax-benefits, but there are some differences. If you want your current investments and future savings to grow tax-deferred, consider these options:
          </p>
          <h2>Option 2: Leave it </h2>

          <p class="body">
            <br />It is not common to leave your 401(k) after people part ways with their employers. That is of course if they let you keep it there in the first place (click on True Stories above). However, it is an option. There are a couple of downsides to leaving your 401(k) at your past employers. For starters, you can't contribute anymore. Again, it's designed for employers to get their employees to contribute. So, if you are not working there anymore, the employer does not need to let you. Second, you are stuck paying high administrative, investment related, and distribution fees if you leave it. However, they can be lower than the fees and expenses that IRAs have. Contact your employer's retirement plan administrator to learn more about your plan's policy. Lastly, the limited options of investments that are selected by the employer. 
          </p>
          <p class="body">If you have a considerable amount saved, are happy with the fees and its investment portfolio options, then doing nothing and leaving your 401(k) at your previous employer is fine. But if you are not impressed with its investment options, unhappy with fees, and likely to forget about the account, consider these next options.</p>
          
          <h2>Option 3: Move It</h2>
          <p class="body"><br/> If you quit your old job to start working at a higher paying job, find out if your new employer offers a 401(k). Then find out when you are eligible to participate and if you can roll over your old 401(k) to your new one. However, it all depends on your new employer's plan. Sometimes this option is not available. But if it is, the best way to go about it is by electing to have the administrator from your old employer to directly deposit the contents of the plan into your new plan by merely filling out paperwork. Otherwise, you can designate to have your old administrator cash out and send you a check. You then have to deposit that into your new 401(k) account within 60 days to avoid paying taxes on distributions.</p>
          
          <p class="body">
            Consolidating your old 401(k)s can be a good idea if the new employer plan is cost effective and it gives you less important things to keep track of. But if you feel like your new employer's administrator fees are too high or you are unhappy with the investment options, consider the final choice.
          </p>
          <h2>Option 4: Roll It</h2>
          <p class="body"><br/>
            People should consider this option if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You're retired</li>
            <li>Your new employer does not offer a retirement plan</li>
            <li>Your old plan is not enticing </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">
            The most significant advantage of rolling over your old 401(k) into an IRA is the freedom to invest in what you want and how you want. The second most significant advantage is having the freedom to invest where you want. You can shop around broker-dealers and advisors to figure out which fees or business models you like. Remember, if you roll over to a <a href="Traditional-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Traditional IRA</a>, there are still Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) the year your turn 70 ½. <a href="Roth-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Roth IRAs</a> do not have RMDs.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            If you do decide to roll over your 401(k) to an IRA, the process is similar to moving it to your new employers 401(k). You can designate your old plans administrator to directly or elect to receive a check to deposit it into your IRA within the 60-day rollover period. Depending on the broker that you choose, they might be able to handle it with a click of a button and file paperwork online. 
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="body"><br/>Regardless of what you decide to do, make sure you do your own due diligence as stated in MOD 9. You have to be comfortable and know all the facts before making an important decision. That being said, we compiled a couple of tables that summarize the essential details of each option you have:</p>

            If you do decide to move roll over your 401(k), remember that there are a multitude of factors that go into the decision-making process of choosing the right investment that is good for you:
          </p>
         <ul>
           <li>
            Obtaining and understanding your capacity to take risk and your emotional tolerance to risk. Also known as your risk profile.
           </li>
           <li>
            Diversifying between the right mix of investments (Stocks, Bonds, ETFs, Mutual Funds, CDs, etc.). Also known as asset allocation.
           </li>
           
           <li>
            Having a real financial plan. Whether it's figuring out when to rebalance, how often to contribute, assigning beneficiaries, when to make asset allocation changes or having a contingency plan.
           </li>
         </ul>
        

        
          <p class="body">
