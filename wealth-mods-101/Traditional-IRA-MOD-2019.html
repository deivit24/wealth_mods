            There are many investment and savings vehicles out there that are
            designed to help you prepare for one of the most challenging financial
            goals you can have - retirement. You can save all your money into a
            checking account, savings account, a Certificate Deposits (CDs) or
            even putting all your hard earned cash under a mattress but that is
            not recommended. However, there is an investment vehicle that has
            extraordinary tax benefits:
          </p>

          <h2>Traditional IRA</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <br />The Individual Retirement Account or IRA is like a cousin to the
            <a class="link" href="401k-MOD-2019.html"> 401(k)</a>. It’s a portable retirement account that is not associated with
            an individual’s employer. A Traditional IRA is an account that offers
            similar tax advantages to those of a 401(k).
          </p>

          <p class="body">
            Here are the essential features of a Traditional IRA:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The only person that can contribute and own an IRA is yourself. Both
              you and your spouse may each have one but not share it.
            </li>

            <li>
              Anyone with Earned Income is eligible to contribute to a Traditional
              IRA regardless of how much you make.
            </li>

            <li>
              For 2019, you can contribute a max of $6,000. If you are older than
              50, you can contribute up to $7,000.
            </li>

            <li>
              Contributions are tax-deductible; in laymen terms, you can
              “write-off” these contributions as expenses, thus lowering your
              taxable income.
            </li>

            <li>
              The growth of the contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't
              be taxed unless you withdraw them.
            </li>

            <li>
              Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
            </li>

            <li>
              Early Withdrawals have a 10% tax penalty unless you meet certain
              conditions.
            </li>

            <li>
              There is a Required Minimum Distribution at 70 1/2. It's time to pay
              your taxes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="body">
            Traditional IRAs are a great investment vehicle when it comes to
            saving for retirement, especially for individuals that are looking for
            that last minute tax-break. This is true if you are in the
            accumulation phase of your life because at some point, you will reach
            the peak of your earning income years and you will be in a high
            tax-bracket. Once you reach your preservation phase of life -
            retirement, you will most likely be in a lower tax bracket. Hence when
            you withdraw from your Traditional IRA account; you will minimize the
            tax burden. Unlike the <a href="Roth-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Roth IRA</a>, you can always contribute
            the full
            amount ($6,000 or $7,000 depending on age) regardless of how much
            money you make. However, there are Traditional IRA Qualifications and
            Deduction Limits.
          </p>

          <h2>Deduction Qualifications</h2>

          <p class="body">
            <br />The ability to deduct your contributions from a Traditional IRA
            will typically hinge on your income and participation in your
            employer’s retirement plan.
          </p>
          <p class="body">You can fully deduct all your contributions if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Married and both you and your spouse do not participate in a
              retirement plan through your employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Single and you do not participate in a 401(k) or any retirement plan
              through your employer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">You can partially deduct your contributions if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If either you or your spouse participates in a retirement plan from
              your employer and the amount that can be deducted depend on your
              MAGI (Modified Adjusted Gross Income).
            </li>
            <li>
              The table below has a full breakdown of the Traditional IRA income
              limits based on your MAGI (Modified Adjusted Gross Income).

          <h2>Things To Consider</h2>
          <ul>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong> – Remember,
              Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred (you pay taxes later) that is the
              day when Uncle Sam says “enough is enough, it’s time to pay your
              taxes.” The IRS requires you take out a minimum amount at the end of
              every year starting on April 1st of the year following the year you
              turn 70½.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdrawal Penalties</strong> – You can withdraw money from
              your account, whether it's from your contributions or gains, without
              incurring a tax penalty after the age of 59 ½. If you withdraw
              before the tender age of 59 ½, you are subject to a 10% penalty tax.
              However, there are certain exceptions that you may qualify for to
              waive the penalty if you decide to withdraw due to these reasons:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>You are disabled</li>
              <li>First home purchase (up to $10,000 max)</li>
              <li>Post-secondary education expenses</li>
              <li>Certain medical bills</li>
              <li>
                You are unemployed for at least twelve weeks, and you need to make
                insurance premium payments
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <br />As you can see, the Traditional IRA account has far more upsides
            than downsides. However, you must always do your due diligence when
            deciding if a Traditional IRA will benefit you. We have compiled the
            pros and cons of having a Traditional IRA account to summarize:

                <li>
                  If you or your spouse participate in your employer's retirement
                  plan, your deductions from contributions might be reduced or
                  eliminated
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you withdraw before you are 59 ½, you will not only be taxed
                  as ordinary income, but you will be subject to pay a 10% penalty
                  unless the withdrawal qualifies to be waived (as mentioned up
                  above)
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are RMDs – at age 70 ½, you must start withdrawing, and
                  you can’t contribute anymore past that age
                </li>

            The most significant caveat of all is that fact that you have to
            select the investments that go to the account. People always tend to
            forget or don’t realize that IRA Accounts are just buckets that hold
            investments (Stocks, Bonds, ETFs, Mutual Funds, CDs, etc.), not an
            investment itself. There is a multitude of factors that go into the
            decision-making process of choosing the right investment that is good
            for you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Obtaining and understanding your capacity to take risk and your
              emotional tolerance to risk. Also known as your risk profile.
            </li>

            <li>
              Diversifying between the right mix of investments (Stocks, Bonds,
              ETFs, Mutual Funds, CDs, etc.). Also known as asset allocation.
            </li>

            <li>
              Having a real financial plan. Whether it's figuring out when to
              rebalance, how often to contribute, assigning beneficiaries, when to
              make asset allocation changes or having a contingency plan.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">
            Rightfully choosing the right investments takes a substantial amount
            of planning. If you don’t have time or you are unsure about how to
            even begin, get in touch with your Financial Advisor to help you out with your current
            situation or feel free to <a href="https://armisfinancial.com/" class="link" target="a_blank">reach out</a>
