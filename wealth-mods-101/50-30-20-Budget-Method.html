         <p class="body">During my college years, when I would hear the word "budget," I would always translate it to "suffer."</p>
         <p class="body">I just thought that they go hand in hand. For the longest time, I avoided budgeting, so I didn't have to suffer. However, thanks to the mentors I had in the past, I realized budgeting shouldn't equate to suffering, but suffering less in the future. </p>
         <p class="body">"But what about the present?"</p>
         <p class="body">I've wrestled with that question in the past before. Most of our lives will be spent during the accumulation phase (saving money). This can roughly be anywhere from 30 to 50 years of our lives, not including the time in college. So why am I going to stop my daily run to Starbucks or Summermoon here in Austin, or unsubscribe to Netflix or Crunchyroll, or stop going to my weekly bubble tea run? Is it worth sacrificing the things I enjoy, to splurge during the preservation phase (Retirement) of my life? </p>
         <p class="body">These questions are tough to answer, especially as a financial advisor. I have a duty to make sure my clients are put in the best position to reach their financial goals (Retirement 95% of the time). But I am a firm believer in enjoying the journey of the accumulation phase of your life. Not only because it's the longest part, but because you are there physically and mentally as well. </p>
         <p class="body">Is there a way to save for your financial goals while not sacrificing the things you enjoy in the process? Let me introduce the 50/30/20 Budgeting Method:</p>
        
          <h2>The 50/30/20 Method</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>The difference between the 50/30/20 method and your conventional budgeting method is that it gives personal spending its own category. Your traditional method only has two categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expenses </strong>– This encompasses every expense you have, whether it's a fixed, variable, discretionary, or essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Savings </strong>– This encompasses the money you put into your savings and investment accounts; such as IRAs, 401(k), and individual accounts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">However, the primary goal of the 50/30/20 method is to divide your monthly after-tax paycheck or income into three categories:</p>
          <h2>50% Essentials:</h2>
          <p class="body"><br>This means that 50% of your income should go into your essential expenses. Furthermore, it will also be beneficial to divide that into two subcategories: Fixed essentials and Variable essentials.</p>
          
          <h3>Fixed Essentials</h3>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mortgage or Rent </strong>– That roof over your head.</li>
            <li><strong>Car Payments and/or Car Insurance </strong>– in case you own a car.</li>
            <li><strong>Cell Phone Bill </strong>– Come on, I know you need this.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Bill </strong>– Unless you only need your cell phone.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan or Credit Card Minimums </strong>– It's vital for you to make on-time payments to your debts. Trying to avoid paying late fees while increasing your Credit Score is always a good idea!</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Variable Essentials</h3>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Groceries</strong> – Because it's essential to eat!</li>
            <li><strong>Utilities</strong> – How are you going to charge your cell phone?</li>
            <li><strong>Gas</strong> – You know, when you want to go anywhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Other</strong> – These are other bills that one may have that might not have on a consistent monthly basis. Maybe you need a dog sitter when you go on vacation or daycare costs, prescription medication, oil change and etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="body">It is crucial to identify what are you fixed expenses and your variable expenses so you can be flexible in what you need to modify.</p>

           <h2>30% Personal Spending</h2>
           <p class="body"><br>The personal spending category is what makes this budgeting method worthwhile. This is not essential to your living, but it's what makes living enjoyable to you. 30% is a lot! Some common examples would be:</p>

           <ul>
             <li><strong>Eating Out</strong> – Who isn't a foody?</li>
             <li><strong>Shopping For…Stuff</strong> – Whether its clothes, electronics, or appliances, there are always great sales throughout the year that you can't pass up.</li>
             <li><strong>Movies and Drinks</strong> – Some say that socializing and building connections with people is very important, but probably only extroverts that say that.</li>
             <li><strong>Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Crunchyroll</strong> – For those introverts that prefer to stay at home and not socialize (that's me).</li>
             <li><strong>Vacations</strong> – For many people and millennials, in particular, they might see this as being essential, but it's not necessary for living. Traveling and taking vacations, however, is important but you save for it.</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>20% Financial Goals</h2>
           <p class="body"><br>Your financial goals category is vital because it helps you focus on saving for your future self. It's always a good idea to invest in yourself. It turns out that having more money is more fun than having less. </p>

           <ul>
            <li><strong>Savings</strong> – The most crucial step to take, if you haven't already, is to start putting money away in a savings account to build up your emergency savings. It's crucial in case of any unexpected expenses that come your way. You have to be prepared for that so it won't hinder any progress you had towards your financial goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Investments</strong> – This may include employer-sponsored retirement plans such as your <a href="401k-MOD-2019.html" class="link">401(k)</a> and your <a href="Traditional-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Traditional IRA</a> or <a href="Roth-IRA-MOD-2019.html" class="link">Roth IRA</a>. </li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Debt</strong> – Paying the minimums is essential, but anything above the minimum will help you get out of debt faster. The quicker you pay off your debt, the more money you have for your other financial goals or personal spending!</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Why It Works</h2>
           <p class="body"><br>By dividing your expenses into three broad categories, you will start to see what is important to you and find out where you can be flexible. This method also works for those that hate or are scared of spreadsheets! </p>
           <p class="body">As I said before, I am a big believer in enjoying the journey – especially when it comes to retirement or any financial goals you may have. And the 50/30/20 doesn't deny yourself from the fun you deserve. </p>

           <h2>MODs For Success</h2>
           <p class="body"><br>Time to talk about a couple of MODs for success using the 50/30/20 budgeting method. Let's start with the most you should put towards Essentials – 50%. That's right, 50% should be the most.</p>
           <p class="body">If all your essential bills – fixed and variable, are more than 50% of your total take-home pay, you are going to need to make modifications. If at all possible, your housing (rent/mortgage, utilities, internet and etc.) should be no more than 30% of your take-home income. If it is, consider the following:</p>
           <ul>
             <li><strong>Downsizing</strong> – It's not ideal, but it could be the secret sauce for making substantial progress.</li>
             <li><strong>Find A Roommate </strong> – Depending on your situation, this might be perfect by cutting you housing in half. That is extra money you don't have to spend.</li>
             <li><strong>Live With Your Parents</strong> – Setting your pride aside and if this is even possible, this could be very beneficial towards your goals. Offering to help with maintenance costs or helping to pay for property taxes is a must. Remember that they love you and will want to see you succeed.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>How about your other essentials?</h3>
           <p class="body">Take a hard look at your TV, Mobil and Internet Bills. Are there any premium services you can live without? Is there any bundle plan that will be cheaper? Tried switching to a different cell phone service provider? I recently switched to T-Mobile, and they pay my Netflix bill! Killed two birds with one stone. Shopping around for cheaper essential services may take time but may be worth the time!</p>
           <p class="body">Now let's take a look at the next most significant chunk - personal spending. 30% for personal spending looks like a lot but double check your bank statements and highlight all those expenses, and you will see that this number is kind of easy to reach for some people.  </p>
           <p class="body">How often to do you go out to eat? Not saying stop going out to eat, but it doesn't hurt to see if you can be flexible in this area. Hate sounding like my mother but do you really need a soft drink? I mean, it's terrible for you. As minuscule of a saving that may be, it compounds over time, especially if you go out as much as I do!</p>
           <p class="body">All these flexible modifications are at your disposal, and its whole purpose is for the last 20% category – your Financial Goals. 20% is not hard to reach, especially if you take time out of your day to sit down, and split your expenses into these three categories. If you can save more than 20%, then go for it. Having more cushion in your emergency savings feels amazing; or if you want to get ahead in your IRAs.</p>
           
        <h2>What if the numbers don't add up?</h2>
        <p class="body"><br>Of course, everybody is in a different situation. This 50/30/20 plan doesn't work for everyone. You might have high student loan debt that is eating up most of your take-home pay. Or your income is not enough to sustain the housing costs in the area that you live. </p>
        <p class="body">Maybe the reason can be that this method is too basic and you really love spreadsheets (it's a real thing).</p>
        <p class="body">Maybe the 50/30/20 budgeting method still equates to "suffering."</p>
        <p class="body">Regardless of the reasons it may not work… It's OK.</p>
        <p class="body">What is important is that you realized that you need to have a budget, now you just need to take the first step, whether it's today or tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="body">Financial planning takes time, and many variables come into play. It's not all about cutting expenses and living miserably. With the right plan, anybody can start saving while still having an enjoyable life.</p>
